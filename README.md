# Food Tales

Food Tales is an internal service designed to help employees decide on a lunch place. This backend service supports various features for restaurants to upload menus and employees to vote on their preferred lunch options.

## System Overview

- Restaurants can upload their daily menus via API.
- Employees can vote on menus using a mobile app.
- The backend supports both old and new versions of the app (app version is sent in request headers).

## Key Features

1. **Authentication**: Secure user authentication system.
2. **Restaurant Management**: 
   - Create restaurant profiles
   - Upload daily menus for restaurants
3. **Employee Interaction**:
   - Create employee profiles
   - View current day's menus
   - Vote for restaurant menus
     - Old API: Single menu vote
     - New API: Vote for top three menus with points (1 to 3)
   - View voting results for the current day

## Constraints

- A restaurant can upload only one menu per day.
- An employee can cast only one vote per day (either old or new version) to avoid duplicate votes.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Django Rest Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Documentation**: Postman (Swagger/OpenAPI also included for devs)
- **Testing**: Unit tests implemented
